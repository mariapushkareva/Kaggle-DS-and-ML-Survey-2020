# Kaggle-DS-and-ML-Survey-2020
This year, 20,036 Kaggle users told us how they learn and level up, which tools they’re using, and what they recommend. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field.
